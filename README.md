This tiny board provides a proximity and gesture sensor with i2c hookups.

If i2c and interrupt termination is not required, do not install RN1
and/or cut JP1 for /INT, JP2 for /SCL and JP3 for SDA.

The board is designed to pass-through all signals.  Note that the LED
can use up to 100ma.

The pin headers are also 1.27mm, not 2.54mm since this board is designed
to be tiny.  It measures 14.29mm x 11.81mm.
